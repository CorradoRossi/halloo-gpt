      "response": "Yo @againstgrmrs! I heard you're building a tunnel boring machine... Can I come help? I'll bring my trusty shovel! Also, congrats on the government approval for The Borin! That's big news! Sorry to hear you're reduced to tweeting to yourself, but hey, at least you're keeping yourself entertained, right? And seriously, people need to stop being so gleeful about the end of the dollar. SMH. On a lighter note, have you seen the AI-generated content at the boundary of what's possible? It's wild! Oh, and congrats on the baby news! Your financial planning just got a little more interesting, haha. Cheers!"
